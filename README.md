# XenonStack-Task2
This project is a secure and straightforward web application integrating a login and signup system, along with a contact us page. Leveraging HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the frontend, the backend is powered by Node.js, MongoDB for database storage, and JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user authentication.
